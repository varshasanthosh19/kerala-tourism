    <p>Kilimanoor Palace honours one among the finest artists to ever grace the shores of Kerala, Raja Ravi Varma. His paintings have invited intrigue and recognition from the entire world. Born as royalty in the halls of Kilimanoor Palace, today his work is hailed by contemporary artists and scholars in the field. Located in Thiruvananthapuram district, it is here that he first learned the rudiments of painting as a five-year-old, when he started to draw using charcoal, using the palace walls as his canvas. The main entrance leads one to the studio, where Raja Ravi Varma used to spend a great deal of time for making some of his finest creations. A studio right next to the palace displays the reproduced works of Raja Ravi Varma's famous paintings. The Kilimanoor Palace, spread over 15 acres of land comprises the traditional residential structures of Kerala like the Nalukettu, small and medium sized buildings, ponds, wells and sacred groves.</p>
